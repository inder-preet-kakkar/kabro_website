    "text": "Welcome to my website, KabroAI! My name is Inder Preet and I’m a data scientist interested in algorithms and models specializing in Edge AI, a cutting-edge technology that brings machine learning and artificial intelligence to devices at the edge of the network. It involves developing intelligent systems that run on devices with limited computing resources, such as smartphones, robots, wearables, and IoT sensors.\nIn addition to my work in Edge AI, I have worked on a lot of other things, like, time-series analysis, AI for Earth Observation, Privacy Preserving ML and most recently optimization for energy management in buildings. Checkout my portfolio for more information on all these. \n\n\nGet in touch\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Edge AI or collaborating on a project, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations who share my passion for bringing intelligent systems to the edge of the network.\nContact: singhinderpreet1995[at]gmail[dot]com"

    "text": "Summary\nDesigning the whole edge AI pipeline – edge based neural network architecture, pruning and quantization techniques and automatic embedded code generation.\n\n\nThe story\nThe work in Edge AI was done mainly under a technology demonstrator (or proof of concept) for CeADAR - Ireland’s Center for Applied AI, which you can check here. The whole edge AI pipeline starting from creating a deep neural network with low memory and computational footprint to pruning and quantizing that network for deployment and finally automatically generating embedded code to deploy the network on an embedded device running ARM processor. The diagram below summarises the project.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1: Overview of complete Edge AI pipeline\n\n\n\nCollaborating with Dr. Deepu John, the problem we tackled was anomaly detection in heartbeats and we proposed a novel architecture inspired from auto-encoders. Adding additional neurons for feature augmentation to auto-encoders and chopping off the decoded layer we got a classifier with very low memory and computational footprint, making it easier to deploy on edge. The diagram below shows the architecture.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 2: Architecture of deep neural network deployed at the edge\n\n\n\nWe also created a novel pruning technique based on the ability of neurons to separate classes. This technique was patented and published and the diagram below shows the metric we proposed class-separation score (css). For more details check the paper here.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 3: Class-separation-score, a metric we designed to prune neural networks\n\n\n\nOn the side, a collaboration with UCD Laboratory for Advanced Manufacturing Simulation and Robotics led to the paper, “Review and application of Edge AI solutions for mobile collaborative robotic platforms”, in Procedia CIRP, which can be found here.\nEdge AI is still an exciting field with lots of new inventions coming frequently, like more specialized hardware and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for the edge. I am eager to explore these new areas in edge AI.\n\n\n\nImportant links\n\nPublications\n\nI. Preet, O. Boydell and D.
