    "text": "Welcome to my website, KabroAI! My name is Inder Preet and I’m a data scientist interested in algorithms and models specializing in Edge AI, a cutting-edge technology that brings machine learning and artificial intelligence to devices at the edge of the network. It involves developing intelligent systems that run on devices with limited computing resources, such as smartphones, robots, wearables, and IoT sensors.\nIn addition to my work in Edge AI, I have worked on a lot of other things, like, time-series analysis, AI for Earth Observation, Privacy Preserving ML and most recently optimization for energy management in buildings. Checkout my portfolio for more information on all these. \n\n\nGet in touch\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Edge AI or collaborating on a project, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations who share my passion for bringing intelligent systems to the edge of the network.\nContact: singhinderpreet1995[at]gmail[dot]com"

    "text": "Summary\nDesigned novel neural network architecture, pruning and quantization techniques and embedded code for heartbeat classification and collaborative robotic platforms.\n\n\nThe story\nSpanning over an year, working at at CeADAR - Ireland’s Center for Applied AI, I worked on multiple areas of the Edge AI pipeline collaborating with multiple researchers.\nWe created a technology demonstrator (or proof of concept), which you can check here where the whole edge AI pipeline starting from creating a deep neural network with low memory and computational footprint to pruning and quantizing that network for deployment and finally automatically generating embedded code to deploy the network on an embedded device running ARM processor. The diagram below summarises the project. \nThe problem we tackled was anomaly detection in heartbeats and we proposed a novel architecture inspired from auto-encoders with additional neurons for feature augmentation to keep the memory footprint of the neural network small. The diagram below shows the architecture. \nWe also created a novel pruning technique based on the ability of neurons to separate classes. This technique was patented and published and the diagram below shows the metric we proposed class-separation score (css). For more details check the paper here. \nI also collaborated with UCD Laboratory for Advanced Manufacturing Simulation and Robotics to review edge AI techniques for collaborative robots. The review paper can be found here.\n\n\n\nImportant links\n\nPublications\n\nI. Preet, O. Boydell and D.
