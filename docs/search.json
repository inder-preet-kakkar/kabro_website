My name is Inder Preet and Iâ€™m a data scientist interested in algorithms and models specializing in Edge AI, a cutting-edge technology that brings machine learning and artificial intelligence to devices at the edge of the network. It involves developing intelligent systems that run on devices with limited computing resources, such as smartphones, robots, wearables, and IoT sensors.\nIn addition to my work in Edge AI, I have worked on a lot of other things, like, time-series analysis, AI for Earth Observation, Privacy Preserving ML and most recently optimization for energy management in buildings. Checkout my portfolio for more information on all these. \nI believe that personal and professional lives are complexly intertwined, so instead of creating a solely professional website, this one is a mix of both and you will see the two themes across the portfolio and blog. The same goes for the name KabroAI, which comes from my familyâ€™s business of selling motor parts. But wonâ€™t deny it is also a catchy name ðŸ˜‰.\n\nGet in touch\nIf youâ€™re interested in learning more about Edge AI or collaborating on a project, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch. Iâ€™m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations who share my passion for bringing intelligent systems to the edge of the network.\nContact: singhinderpreet1995[at]gmail[dot]com"
