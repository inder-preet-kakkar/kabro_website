### Summary
Developed standards and specifications for European Space Agency and worked on image segmentation for EO data.

### The story
Earth Observation (EO) data, comprising of data coming from satellites or drones presents vast opportunities for
industry and AI. As such, we worked on [AIREO](https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/aireo/) with European Space Agency to formulate
specifications and standards for EO data so that it can be easily used by the AI community.

We gathered surveys from the community and then specified standards for EO data including what metadata should be present
and how we can make it easier to ingest EO data into tools commonly used by AI practitioners. Best practices on how
to train ML algorithms on EO data were also laid down.

We also worked on the problem of image segmentation in satellite images. Figure below shows a satellite image on the left
with segmentation map consisting of roads, water, buildings and forest.

A common problem with segmentation in satellite images is that often the ground truth is not completely labelled, e.g.,
some roads might be left out of the labels in training data. Training a deep neural network becomes difficult as we do not
have the complete ground truth, as such we need to design the loss function such that if we are confident enough in
 some prediction we incorporate that in ground truth. To do that we use GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and borrow
 ideas from two different studies, [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) and one by [Mittal et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05724) Additional terms to the loss function were added
 and some modifications to the latter's pipeline were made. These modifications yielded better segmentation accuracy for some classes in the dataset.
