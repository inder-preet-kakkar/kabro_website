### Summary
Developed standards and specifications for European Space Agency and worked on image segmentation for EO data.

### The story
Earth Observation (EO) data, comprising of data coming from satellites or drones presents vast opportunities for
industry and AI. As such, we worked on [AIREO](https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/aireo/) with European Space Agency to formulate
specifications and standards for EO data so that it can be easily used by the AI community.

We gathered surveys from the community and then specified standards for EO data including what metadata should be present
and how we can make it easier to ingest EO data into tools commonly used by AI practitioners. Best practices on how
to train ML algorithms on EO data were also laid down.
