### Summary
Pedagogic activities for companies wanting to adopt Privacy Preserving Machine Learning (PPML).

### The story
Privacy is increasingly becoming a concern with vast amounts of data and advanced ML/AI algorithms. There are several ways
in which ML can help preserve privacy. In this project at [CeADAR](https://ceadar.ie/), we created a series of short videos
covering the different ways like anonymization, synthetic data generation and differential privacy which can be used
to make data more private. We also created a short course on PPML accessible to CeADAR's members.
Below we list the pedagogic videos we created during the project.


1. Technical discussion with a few industry experts working on PPML
