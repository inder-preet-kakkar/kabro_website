### Summary
Designed novel neural network architecture, pruning and quantization techniques and embedded code for heartbeat classification and collaborative robotic platforms.

### The story
Spanning over an year, working at at [CeADAR](https://ceadar.ie/) - Ireland's Center for Applied AI, I worked on multiple areas of the Edge AI pipeline collaborating with multiple researchers.

We created a technology demonstrator (or proof of concept), which you can check [here](https://ceadar.ie/blog/edge-ai/) where the whole edge AI pipeline starting from creating a deep neural network with low memory and computational footprint
to pruning and quantizing that network for deployment and finally automatically generating embedded code to deploy the network on an embedded device running ARM processor. The diagram below summarises the project.

The problem we tackled was anomaly detection in heartbeats and we proposed a novel architecture inspired from auto-encoders with additional neurons for feature augmentation to keep the memory footprint
of the neural network small. The diagram below shows the architecture.

We also created a novel pruning technique based on the ability of neurons to separate classes. This technique was patented and published and the diagram below shows the metric we
proposed `class-separation score (css)`. For more details check the paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9982427/).

I also collaborated with UCD Laboratory for [Advanced Manufacturing Simulation and Robotics](https://www.ucd.ie/lams/) to review edge AI techniques for collaborative robots.
The review paper can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827122003961).
