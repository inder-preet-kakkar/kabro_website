### Summary
Explored support vector machines for hind casting wind speed data for wind farms and created an open-source library for wind energy analysis.

### The story
What started as my master's thesis on wind resource assessment turned into first open source python library for wind
energy analytics. Working at [Brightwind Analysis](https://www.brightwindanalysis.com/) we were looking at ways to predict the wind energy at a site using machine learning. It is necessary to
 predict it accurately for the next twenty years before setting up a wind farm to evaluate financial viability of setting up a farm.
 We ended up writing enough code to feel the need to
open source it so other analysts can save time using it. It ended up being a popular project with many adopting the tool
for their everyday wind energy assessment.

The documentation of the library can be found [here](https://brightwind-dev.github.io/brightwind-docs/).

Some cool things the library can do:
